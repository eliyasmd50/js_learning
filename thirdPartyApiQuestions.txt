General API Design and Integration
What are the key considerations when designing an API for third-party integrations?
Explain the difference between REST, GraphQL, and SOAP. When would you choose each?
What is API versioning, and why is it important? How would you implement it?
What are the best practices for securing APIs that integrate with third-party services?
What is the purpose of rate limiting in an API, and how would you implement it?

Third-Party Service Integration
How would you integrate a third-party email service like SendGrid or Amazon SES into an application?
Explain how you would use APIs to integrate with social networks like Facebook, Twitter, or LinkedIn.
What are common challenges when integrating with third-party APIs, and how do you handle them?
How do you handle authentication when connecting to third-party APIs (e.g., OAuth 2.0, API keys)?
What steps would you take to test and validate an integration with a third-party service?

API Design and Reliability
What is the difference between synchronous and asynchronous API calls? When would you use each?
How do you ensure an API remains reliable when a third-party service is down or unresponsive?
Explain how you would design an API to support pagination and filtering.
What is the role of webhooks in API integrations, and how would you implement them?
How do you handle retries and error handling when consuming a third-party API?

Security and Compliance
How do you ensure that sensitive data transmitted to or from a third-party service is secure?
What are CORS, and how do they affect API integrations?
How would you handle data privacy concerns when integrating with social networks or email services?
What strategies do you use to manage API tokens securely in an application?
How do you ensure compliance with regulations like GDPR or CCPA when integrating with third-party APIs?

Real-World Scenarios
Describe how you would integrate a payment gateway (e.g., Stripe, PayPal) into an application.
You need to pull user data from a social media platform's API, but the API imposes strict rate limits. How would you handle this?
How would you handle a situation where a third-party API changes its contract (e.g., modifies its response structure)?
What steps would you take to optimize API calls when integrating with a slow third-party service?
How would you log and monitor the interactions between your application and third-party APIs?

Error Handling and Performance
What is your approach to handling API errors such as 4xx and 5xx responses?
How do you prevent or minimize the impact of API downtime on your application?
What tools or libraries have you used to manage API integrations effectively?
How do you ensure the scalability of an application that integrates with multiple third-party APIs?
What techniques do you use to cache API responses for improved performance?

Behavioral and Experience-Based Questions
Can you describe a project where you integrated with a complex third-party service? What challenges did you face, and how did you resolve them?
Have you ever designed an API specifically for third-party consumption? What were your key design considerations?
How do you ensure that third-party integrations remain maintainable and easy to update over time?
What strategies do you use to work with incomplete or poorly documented third-party APIs?
Can you share an example of how you optimized API integrations to improve performance?
